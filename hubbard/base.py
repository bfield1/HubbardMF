"""
Base class for the Mean field Hubbard model, at the Gamma point only.

    Copyright (C) 2021 Bernard Field, GNU GPL v3+

Has the mixing routines and other things which aren't dependent on the
specifics of the lattice.

There are a few main differences from the parent class HubbardKPoints.
 - While HubbardKPoints dynamically generates the kinetic energy matrix
    for a given k, here the kinetic energy has no variables which change
    mid-calculation, so the kinetic energy matrix is cached as self.kin.
    Many methods here access self.kin directly. set_kinetic is expected to
    set self.kin, rather than merely record parameters.
 - _eigensystem is streamlined to exploit the single k-point calculation.
 - set_kmesh won't do anything other than make the Gamma point.

A key advantage of the Gamma point only routine is that it simplifies some
algorithms. Building kinetic energy matrices is easier without having to figure
out where momentum comes into it. The move_electrons method currently is only
implemented for Gamma point only (although that's mainly a matter of it not being
the most useful method so not worth development time). Having a cached kinetic energy
matrix rather than needing to remember a bunch of parameters can make complex
Hamiltonians easier to deal with.
There might be a small performance improvement as well, although I haven't tested it.

Several things must be defined in the subclasses.
 - The kinetic energy matrix, self.kin. This needs to be set in the 
     initialisation step. Ideally you'd also allow it to be
     changed later. THIS ONE IS IMPORTANT.
 - The copy method. find_magnetic_minimum won't work if this isn't defined. And
    I don't know which data you need to feed into new instances.
 - get_coordinates - returns a (nsites, 2) ndarray which indicates
     the Cartesian coordinates of each site. Used for plotting.
     (I assume a 2D lattice for plotting. 3D plotting will require re-working
     the plotting routines to do 3D plots. That's a job for a subclass.)
 - save and load methods (you don't have to define them, but they aren't
     defined here). (I may find a way to abstract the saving/loading later.)
 - any bespoke electron density setting methods, in _electron_density_single_methods

        Flips the spin of electrons (self-consistently) until we find an

        I do not recommend this method any more, although it is useable.
        A better method is linear_mixing with finite T.
        I note that for large U the energy landscape is difficult to
        traverse. This method (and linear_mixing) will only find a
        local minimum.
