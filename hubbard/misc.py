def choose_alpha(n,total):
    """
    An empirically chosen minimum practical alpha for Dirichlet.
    
    Picks an alpha which, when used with
    bounded_random_numbers_with_sum_dirichlet,
    will result in 1/10 samples being valid. I consider
    this to be a reasonable compromise for low alpha for
    more spread while maintaining okay performance.
    Alpha is chosen by an empirical formula obtained by
    numerical fitting. It is tested for N<=1000 and
    total/N <= 0.6. Does not apply for total/N close to
    1, where alpha should asymptote to infinity (but my
    formula does not).
    I give alpha a lower bound of 1.

    Further testing has found that, typically, the ground state electron
    density will have substantially less spread than what is given
    by this function. You may wish to use a larger value of alpha
    for faster convergence.

    Inputs: n - positive integer, length of list to return.
        total - non-negative number. Value list should sum to.

def bounded_random_numbers_with_sum_dirichlet(n,total,alpha):
    """
    Return a list of n random numbers between 0 and 1 which sum to total.
    
    Uses a Dirichlet distribution, which generates numbers between
    0 and 1 which sum to 1.
    Larger alpha is more likely to converge but has a smaller spread.
    Specifically, small alpha has an exponential-like distribution,
    with many values close to zero but a long tail.
    Large alpha has a bell-curve distribution around total/n.
    alpha should be at least 1. 5 or 10 is okay for half filling.
    If more than half filling, I recommend doing 1-total instead,
    although alpha of 50 or 100 can also be used.
